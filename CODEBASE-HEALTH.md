4. Update relevant sections after major changes

### When Adding New Features
1. Check for existing similar components
2. Follow established patterns in codebase
3. Add tests and documentation
4. Update bundle size metrics if significant

### When Refactoring
1. Update this health monitor
2. Record performance impact
3. Update architecture notes
4. Communicate changes to team

## üîç INVESTIGATION QUEUE

### Performance Mysteries
- [ ] Why is Framer Motion bundle so large?
- [ ] Can we reduce Radix UI footprint?
- [ ] Are all Chart.js features being used?

### Architecture Questions  
- [ ] Should we consolidate all skeleton components?
- [ ] Is current state management optimal?
- [ ] Do we need all these form abstractions?

### Quality Concerns
- [ ] Why do we have both Form approaches?
- [ ] Are we over-engineering some utilities?
- [ ] Can we simplify the filter system?
