# WORKFLOW SYSTEM

*The definitive guide to our 3-file productivity system*

## üéØ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This workflow uses exactly **3 MD files** to maintain codebase excellence:

1. **`CODEBASE-HEALTH.md`** - Automated health monitoring & metrics
2. **`TODO-ACTIVE.md`** - Prioritized task management 
3. **`WORKFLOW-SYSTEM.md`** - This file - system documentation

**Why 3 files?**
- Focused scope prevents documentation bloat
- Each file has a distinct purpose
- Easy to maintain and update
- Scalable for any team size

1. Add automated reminders to Slack/Discord
2. Include file updates in definition of done
3. Review process during retrospectives
4. Simplify if too complex

### Information Overload  
**Problem**: Too much detail, developers avoiding files

**Solutions**:
1. Focus on critical items only
2. Archive detailed information
3. Use visual indicators (üö®‚ö†Ô∏è‚úÖ)
4. Limit file length to 2 screens max

### Conflicting Priorities
**Problem**: Tasks not properly prioritized, confusion about what to work on

**Solutions**:
1. Weekly prioritization meetings
2. Clear business value assignment
3. Time-box decision making
4. Escalation process for conflicts

### Automation Failures
**Problem**: Automated updates not working, manual effort increasing

**Solutions**:
